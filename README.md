# openDTU_wDisplay

Based on idea/ realization of breakout board 
https://github.com/dokuhn/openDTU-BreakoutBoard

Very first beginner trial to do first own PCB.

Unfortunately wrong lib for SSD1306 used, so display is not fully at desired location

Goal is to have a PCB with NodeMCU + nRF chip + SSD1306 display (not size optimized)

Picture of first full assembly:

Issues: None, initially could not get the display running:

However with upgrade of firmware to
https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU/commits/b5d099f
it is running now :).

First version for case can be found in the openscad directory. 
Updated now with picture of case, fits perfectly.
